# HPC Algorithm Optimizations

This repository contains implementations of algorithms optimized for **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** environments. The focus is on accelerating computation using various parallel programming models and architectures.  

âš¡ **Ongoing project:** New algorithms and optimizations are added regularly.

## Features

- Optimized compute kernels for **CUDA** (GPU programming)
- Parallel implementations using **OpenMP** (shared-memory parallelism)
- Distributed computing with **MPI**
- SIMD-based optimizations for vectorized computation
- Examples of accelerated algorithms for common HPC workloads

## Getting Started
